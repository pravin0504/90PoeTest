### Feature

As a user I want to be able to add a list of strings.
I want to see the number of vowels in each of the strings that I have entered.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. I should see the number of vowels and consonant for each string in the order they are keyed in.
2. I should be able to add up to 4 strings at once.

### QA Task

1. Review the user story and prepare a list of questions/ assumptions.

   - 1. what should be the expected behaviour when we passed other than string like - null values, undefined values, integers--- What should be the error message

2. Review the code and provide feedback/ improvements.

   - code is working only for lower case string, we should cover for both lower and upper cases

3. Extend the program to return the number of consonants for each string array passed.

   - added new lines of codes with comments

4. Use BDD/ Cucumber to add test cases to test the program for both vowels and consonants.

5. Report any bugs you find. Include as much information as necessary and add the feedback as a file to the repo along with the Cucumber Test Report.

defect:
Description: Not working for upper cases characters in string
steps to reproduce:
S1. Go to file Launch.json
S2. In key "args", pass the value as a combination of small and upper case strings ( ex. PravEeN KUMar)
S3. run the code
expected behvaior :{PravEeN=3, KUMar - 1}
Actual behvaiour :{KUMar=1, PravEeN=2}
